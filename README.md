## Descriptions
Hole in the Wall is an interactive game in which users stand in front of a screen and initiate their interaction by raising their hand. Once their body is detected, the game commences, and the users must move their bodies to align with the corresponding hole displayed on the screen. The primary objective of the game is to avoid making contact with the virtual wall, and users must use their spatial awareness and motor skills to achieve this goal. After every round, users have the option to continue playing or end the game, and if they fail to avoid the virtual wall, they can start a new game. Hole in the Wall is a challenging and engaging game that promotes physical activity and spatial reasoning, making it an enjoyable experience for players of all ages.

## Tasks aim to address
The present project aims to address various tasks that are centered around improving the mental and physical health of the participants through an interactive interface:
1. Participants are encouraged to engage in physical activities or exercises while interacting with the interface, which can lead to enhanced physical well-being. 
2. The interface offers a gamified element that can be leveraged to promote positive affect and enjoyment among the participants. 
3. The project supports mental challenges or puzzles that can lead to a sense of accomplishment and increased productivity, thereby reducing stress levels. 
4. the interface provides an opportunity for participants to take a break from work and engage in a de-stressing activity, thus uplifting their overall mood. 

## Constraints

## Collaboration
- Alejandro's contribution to the project involves normalizing body coordinates on the z-axis to standardize the virtual body position and updating the virtual body position on the screen. This task is crucial to ensure that the game accurately reflects the user's body position and movements, thus enhancing the overall experience.
- Tony is responsible for implementing the game state checking functionality to update the score and display "continue game" or "game over" messages. He is also working on using hand position as input to start the game, which is a critical aspect of the game's interactivity. Additionally, Tony is involved in the styling of the gameover page and instructions page.
- Zayyan's contribution to the project involves creating a random hole coordinate generator and implementing a function that checks if the body shape matches the hole. These tasks are essential to ensure that the game's difficulty and challenge level are consistent, which contributes to the overall enjoyment of the game.
- Lindsay works on the user tracking feature, allowing the game to detect and respond to the user's hand movements, enabling them to start and continue the game. She is also responsible for implementing a timer in the game and error handling, such as detecting when the body moves out of the screen.
